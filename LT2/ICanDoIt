Create a file called ICanDoIt containing commands to do the following (not a script, just a file for the TA to grade):

A command to create a file called Help! I've run out of $s (0.1%).
touch "Help! I've run out of \$s"

An command that lists all the files (in the current directory) that start with an alphabetic character, contain a digit, and end with a dot followed by a lowercase character then one more character (0.4%).
ls -l | grep -E "[a-zA-Z]+.*[0-9].*\.[a-z].$"

A pipeline command from head to tail to grep, that will extract lines containing Computer Science course codes as distinct words from the 5th to 12th lines of this file. The "CSC" must start with an uppercase "C" but the "SC" may be written in any combination of uppercase and lowercase. A correct solution extracts lines numbered 5, 7, 10, and 12. (0.5%)
head -n 12 CSCCodes | tail -n 8 | grep -E "\bC[sS][cC][0-9]{3}\b"
